  - 47

  # NOTE: i did merge 51 and 54, which are in the same plane. i don't think i've tested
  # my merging code on this case yet, so check that it is behaving properly

  # Some signal in middle but then also on-off transients later.
  - 48

  # ...could these be the same thing? If so, where are the ROIs in the two planes in
  # between. Their signals do look similar tho...
  # NOTE: looks like i currently have 17 merged as part of 68
  # Just marking 17 bad for now cause it does seem like they might be the same, looking
  # at responses.

  # over / restore from backup. marking 22 bad for now.

  # Should one or both of these also be a part of 73? They are a bit noisy...

  # Maybe 65,66 just share a little out of plane signal from each other (or maybe more
  # one way than the other...)?
  # Bit small (+ noisier at beginning as a lot of ROIs in this recording)
  # Doesn't seem to be same as 66 below it, unless 66 over merged and *maybe* part, tho

  - 65
  # May be overmerged. Bit elongated.

# lots of ugly drifts on this one + the df/f image looks like nothing (tho perhaps upper

# some glomeruli that might have nice responses.
# suite2p also didn't seem to do that well...
# maybe this fly was kinda responding to everything (or at least the few glomeruli that
# seemed to show nice-ish responses), while also slowly dying?

  # Almost seems acceptable but also not really. Also elongated, but perhaps normal.
  - 146

  # Similar trajectory to 146 tho seemingly spatially separate. Also not good enough

  - 162

  # These two being the same explainable by slow plane shift or something?
  # (w/ 11 getting more of the meat of it by the end, tho still it's noisier than 65 was

  # Noisy enough at start I think I should probably exclude it.
