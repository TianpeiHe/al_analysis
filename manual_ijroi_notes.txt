- add notes about some of ambiguity in top right in some of the higher planes

- 08063-00148-00132 (lower right in 5/6)
  - moved right edge in to try to get less of potential second glomerulus near that
    boundary. may still have some.

  - may also be missing this other glomerulus

- 7136-0084-0025 (top left in 1/5)
  - could maybe be split?
  - case for splitting this might mainly come from half receiving more out-of-plane
    signal from something below? nah...

- in 2/5, top right, again unsure about region between smaller two circular ROIs

- 6823-0124-0036
  - moved top edge dramatically down (to about ~1/2 original extent), to avoid possible
    inclusion of signal from another glomerulus

  - as well as right edge, to avoid overlap w/ 2883-...
  - moved left edge of 2883-... for same reason.

- unsure of whether region above 6823-... should be assigned a new ROI

- how to / should i split 6688-0084-0029? originally i had a circular region in right
  side as its own ROI. also see offset behavior ~1240 (lower edge seemingly off a bit
  later).

- 8554-... (4/5, bottom left)
  - moved bottom edge be moved to avoid overlap

- 8240- may still contain some signal from part of what is above / left of it

- 8245- wasn't clear enough that bottom left region should have been split into its own
  glomerulus, tho suite2p did

- there is an elongated region above 0608- that suite2p picked up, and that could be a
  glomerulus, but might also be too weirdly shaped? suite2p roi in plane above more well
  shaped tho

  i added what is perhaps part of this as 0630-
