- fix how it seems that:
  1. opening expt via F2 in ImageJ
  2. selecting ROI -> p
  3. selecting diff ROI -> P (replaces window from #2 w/ window w/ both ROIs data)
  4. selecting (diff/same?) ROI -> H (pops up 2 new windows)
  5. selecting ROI unique from all above -> P

  ...ultimately creates two comparison windows (as created via P), when there should
  only ever be one comparison window open at a time


- maybe just make H update window (as P does to p window), with Hallem comparison stuff
  at the top? is only reason i might not want to do this that it's a bit unclear which
  ROI below should be compared to Hallem data (e.g. if i already was comparing other
  ROIs from my data, or if i do that with subsequent commands)
