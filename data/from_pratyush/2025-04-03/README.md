Hemibrain bidirectional APL-KC synapse data. KC IDs should correspond to those in
`PNtoKC_connections_raw.xlsx` file he had given me previously.

From Pratyush (on Slack, 2025-04-03):
"""
It has all the pre and post-synaptic partners annotated. There are some fragments of the
APL from the Left side or fragments that could not be assigned definitely to the APL or
DPM.

If you want the max confidence for the APL, just filter to instance == "APL_R"

The connections are separated by roi. If you want only the calyx, you need to filter by
roi == "CA(R)"
