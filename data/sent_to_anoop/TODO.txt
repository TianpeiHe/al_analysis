figure out when i sent v1/v2 -> rename folders to those dates
(could also probably just delete v2, as we never really had him use them as the
modelling was still in flux...)

be clear how v1 still has that 1 fly i asked anoop to drop (2024-01-05/4, at B's
request), and maybe resend him a version w/o it and archive that in a new dir here, just
for clarity to future people?
