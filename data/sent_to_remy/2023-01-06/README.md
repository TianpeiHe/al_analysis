These 4 files (2 CSVs, and 2 pickle files with same data) probably contain the data Remy
used to generate the original ORN / PN correlation matrices in the preprint.

The preprint was posted 2023-02-16 originally, and this was the only data I had seemed
to send to Remy (on Slack) recently before this (on 2023-01-06). I didn't send anything
to her via email during the same time frame.
